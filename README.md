# Module_14

## Overview of Project
This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to present your results. You will submit the following:
<br>
Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format<br>
Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis<br>
Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation<br>

## Purpose
For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders

- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week

- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

## Results

There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis (7 pt)<br>
There is a description of the results for each visualization (7 pt)

- Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format

- Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis

- Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation
