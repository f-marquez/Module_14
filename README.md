# Module_14
NYC CitiBike Challenge

## Overview of Project
This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to present your results. You will submit the following:
<br>
<br>
Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format<br>
Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis<br>
Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation<br>

## Purpose
For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders

- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week

- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

     ## The overwhelming majority of the Citibike Users were Men, more than doubling female and unkown users combined.

     ## In the 2 graph below we can see that the most users checkeout times max out at about the 5 minute mark. 
     We can appreciate in the second graph that the 5 minute mark held as the max ride across genders.

    ## Here we can appreciate that during the weekdays Monday through Friday, the hours often referred to as "rush hour"(7-9am and 5-8PM) found the most trips recorded with Thursday 5-7 pm showing the most amount of trips taken.

  ## When taking a closer look and comparing trips by gender we can see that although men take more trips than female riders, both favour similar riding hours.

**Citibike programs offer a simple transportation alternative for getting around. We are able to see that most riders were renting bikes for short rides regardless of gender. We also noted that riders preferred similar riding time regardless of gender or subscription status.**<br>

**Male users are the overhelming user base for citibike as well as the majority of thier subscriber base. It could be wise to explore the reasons why the large gap between users based on gender and explore potentials ways to encourage more female subscribers.**
